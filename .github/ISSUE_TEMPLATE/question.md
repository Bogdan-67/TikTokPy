**Ask your question**
Explain what you would like to do/know. Specific questions are likely to be answered sooner than vague ones.

**Version Information**
Please include what versions of pydantic, playwright, and tiktokapipy you have installed (can be found with `pip freeze`).

**System Information**
Please provide information about the system you're running the library on. What's the OS? Is it a desktop, server, VM, or container?

**Region Information**
Where in the world are you located? If you're not in the US, it's likely that TikTok treats your region differently, which may present some challenges.

**Additional context**
